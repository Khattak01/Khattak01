ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Khattak01, a dedicated and motivated software developer with a passion for technology and Open Source projects. Iâ€™m always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and contribute to meaningful projects that can make a difference.

With a strong background in Full Stack Development and a wide range of technical skills, including React, Node, Flask, SQL, MongoDB, Firebase, UI Designing, Network Security, Server Configurations, and Python, I am well equipped to handle a variety of challenges and projects.

My projects are available on GitHub, where you can see my passion for software development in action. I am constantly learning new things, driven by my own curiosity and a desire to be the best I can be. Whether it's mastering new technologies or exploring new approaches to software development, I am always eager to take on new challenges.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also friendly and approachable, making me a great collaborator and team player. I have extensive experience with Penetration Testing and software testing, as well as Firewall Configurations, so you can be confident in my ability to help you build secure, reliable applications.

So if you're looking for someone who is self-driven, hard-working, and passionate about software development, I would love the opportunity to collaborate with you on your next Open Source project. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or would like to know more about my experience and skills.
